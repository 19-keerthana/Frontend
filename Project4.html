        By maintaining a balance between human activities and ecological stability, environment 
protection ensures the survival of ecosystems, preserves the planet's natural beauty, and mitigates 
the adverse impacts of global warming. It is not only a responsibility of governments and 
organizations but also of individuals, as small actions like recycling, reducing energy consumption, 
and planting trees can make a significant difference.
